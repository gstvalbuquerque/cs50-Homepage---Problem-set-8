              <li><b>"The Last Wish" (Hachette, 2008):</b>
                <p>
                  The Last Wish (Polish: Ostatnie życzenie) is the first book in Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1993, after Sword of Destiny.

                  Some of the individual short stories were first published in the Fantastyka magazine or in the Wiedźmin short story collection (the first collection of Sapkowski's stories, out of print and now obsolete; all short stories were later collected in The Last Wish, Sword of Destiny and Something Ends, Something Begins) and as such were the first witcher stories published.

                  The first UK edition was released by Gollancz on 7 June 2007 and a second edition was released the next year on 14 February 2008. The US edition was released a few months later, on 1 May 2008 by Orbit.

                  Audible UK, in conjunction with Orion Books and Gollancz, released The Last Wish audio on February 27, 2014, only a few short weeks after it was announced. The Last Wish is read by Peter Kenny.

              <li><b>"Sword of Destiny" (Hachette, 2015)</b>
                <p>
                  Sword of Destiny (Polish: Miecz przeznaczenia) is the second book in Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1992, before The Last Wish (but after the Wiedźmin short story collection made obsolete by The Last Wish). Some of the individual short stories were first published in the Fantastyka magazine.

                  Both English publishers decided to skip Sword of Destiny and publish Blood of Elves (the first novel in the saga) directly after The Last Wish, even though the short stories in this collection take place earlier and introduce some of the characters that become major characters in the novels.

                  The UK edition was subsequently published by Gollancz on 21 May 2015 and the U.S. edition was released by Orbit on 1 December 2015. Gollancz later released a second edition on 10 March 2016.

              <li><b>"Blood of Elves" (Hachette, 2009)</b>
                <p>
                  Blood of Elves (Polish: Krew elfów) is the first novel in the Witcher saga written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is a sequel to the Witcher short story collections Sword of Destiny and The Last Wish, and is continued by Time of Contempt.

                  The UK edition was released on 16 October 2008 by Gollancz, and a 2nd edition was released the following year on 21 May 2009. The U.S. edition was released on 1 May 2009 by Orbit.

              <li><b>"The Time of Contempt" (Hachette, 2013)</b>
                <p>
                  Time of Contempt (UK) or The Time of Contempt (U.S.) (Polish: Czas pogardy) was written by Andrzej Sapkowski, first published in Poland in 1995 by SUPERNOWA, and is the fourth book in The Witcher series and the second novel in the saga. It directly continues on from Blood of Elves, which begins the saga of Ciri and Geralt.

                  The English translation of the novel was originally going to be translated by Danusia Stok but that was eventually changed to David French. It was expected to be published in the fall of 2010. This release date was missed however and saw numerous edits. Gollancz, at the time, was criticized for missing the numerous release dates. This turn of events pushed Baptism of Fire further back.

                  Time of Contempt was first released in the UK on 27 June 2013 (published by Gollancz). A Kindle edition was released simultaneously. A second edition was released on 23 January 2014. A U.S. edition, The Time Of Contempt, was released by Orbit Books on 27 August 2013.

                  Baptism of Fire (Polish: Chrzest ognia), written by Andrzej Sapkowski, was first published in Poland in 1996 and is the fifth book in The Witcher series and the third novel in the saga, thus continuing the saga of Geralt and Ciri directly onwards from the end of Time of Contempt.

                  The first UK edition was released on 6 March 2014 and the U.S. edition was released on 24 June 2014. Both were translated by David French and followed by The Tower of the Swallow. The second UK edition was released the next year on 8 January 2015.
